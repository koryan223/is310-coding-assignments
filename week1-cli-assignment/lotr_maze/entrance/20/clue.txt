You have reached a mountain that seems to be familiar from the story book you read, The Hobbit. There are orcs chasing you and you need to hide right now. Luckily, you remember from the story that there is a secret door on the side of the mountain, but you do not remember where it is or what it looks like. You have finally found two doors but one of them is leading directly to the den of goblins. Between grey and silver door, you need to decided using the quote from "The hobbit" explaining the secret door. There might be a copy of the book HIDDEN somewhere in your backpack.
